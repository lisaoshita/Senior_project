#### Winter break/Week 1

* Data science courses on coursera: 
    + reproducible research
    + logistic and poisson regression courses
    + machine learning
* took notes in r markdown on all courses 

#### Week 2

* Continued learning about machine learning algorithms
    + coursera 
    + text readings 

#### Week 3 

* Applied ml algorithms to iris data set 
* Exploratory analysis on Airbnb's data sets (train_users, age_gender)
    + turned date variables into date time vars 
    + plotted categorical vars as bar charts 
    + looked at missing values 
* applied boosting model with all variables data, achieved 62% accuracy, only predicted US and NDF

#### Week 4 

* Exploratory analysis on all of Airbnb's data sets
    + sampled sessions data 
* became familiar with each of the data sets 
* started feature engineering 
    + pulled apart date variables into month, day, year, weekday, season
    + clean age variable + created age_range variable 
    + cleaned gender variable 
    + one hot encoding of categorical vars 
    + merged age_gender and countries data with train_users (based off of shared variables)
    + with sessions data: took number of occurences of each unique action type for each user
* fit initial boosting model
